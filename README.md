# AR Xmas – Marker-Based Augmented Reality Application

**Student:** Lauren Wright  
**Student ID:** K00300249  

AR Xmas is a marker-based augmented reality (AR) mobile application developed in Unity using AR Foundation and ARCore. The application allows users to scan a printed marker to reveal an interactive virtual Christmas tree placed in the real world. Users can interact with the AR content using on-screen buttons to toggle lights and snowfall effects.

This project was created as part of an AR coursework assignment and focuses on reliable image tracking, clear interaction, and mobile performance.

The GitHub Repo was made in haste due to a lack of reading comprehension from the student (Not naming names or anything).
